Vademecum Parser
====================
Small phython utility to parse [Professor Ma√±as](http://www.dit.upm.es/~pepe/)' Java [Vademecum](http://www.dit.upm.es/~pepe/libros/vademecum/index.html) into a json format for [calista-bot](https://github.com/gsi-upm/calista-bot)

***WARNING: This is development level software.  Please do not use it unless you
             are familiar with what that means and are comfortable using that type
             of software.***

Portability
---------------------------------------

This is mostly a python script (parser.py) I used to web-scrapp the data from the vademecum to a custom json format. Is not a good script, and I don't think it  is really portable. As future work, I plan on changing it to use an actual scrapper, and to write the data to LOM, but I cannot guarantee I'll be able to do it.

Dependencies and Usage
---------------------------------------
You just need python, a Firefox-like browser (I use Iceweasel), and a couple of libaries:

    pip install selenium unidecode

You will also need the "native2ascii" tool, which should come with the openjdk-7-java package.

Just run "run.sh", in the same directory, and it should generate the "vademecum_encoded.json" file, with the data, and "dictionary.txt", a dictionary to be compiled with [Unitex](http://www-igm.univ-mlv.fr/~unitex/)
